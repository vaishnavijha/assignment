Prodigal assignment 

chnages not made in this app: 
This is very simple ar present 
I could not get the api from which calls data were to be taken so the initial table at localhost:3000 is empty but as soon as you filter data starts appearing in the table .

I have provided a link for another component with url as localhost:3000/label which is for adding labels in the calls data, Since I couldnt get any api for gettin g all calls data so table hgere is filled with random data values from the source code itself.
further once I choose a label and click on setlabel , a request is sent to post api call with the provision that one or more than one id can be selected.

The main issue is I am not using any api for initial population of table with data . A lot improvement is to be made in this but sbmitting here just after 4 to 5 hours of getting assigned becuase of lack of time and other work of company at hand .

I tried using the bolierplate code but it gave me error (may be because of some restrictions of using public code of github).I will attach a file showing screenshot of error that came when i tried running npm i on the boilerplate code.

I haven't deployed my app on heroku due to other work at hand and lack of time but will add screenshots of the functionalities.
